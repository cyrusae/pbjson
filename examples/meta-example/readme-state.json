  "what_we_decided": [
    "2026-01-09 - Track README development separately from main project state to keep documentation discussions organized",
    "2026-01-10 - Keep README monolithic with improved navigation (TOC + TL;DR) rather than splitting into multiple files - preserves copy-paste portability and single-file context model",
    "2026-01-10 - Add detailed workflow/usage tips section for handling manual sync, knowing when to refresh state, and managing project context files effectively",
    "2026-01-10 - Create TIPS.md companion file - contains detailed command breakdowns, workflow best practices, troubleshooting, and manual sync guidance. README keeps quick reference only."

  "what_we_built": [
    "2026-01-09 - Examples section added to README between JSON Structure and Best Practices (~line 172-190), includes domain coverage and AI-generated disclosure",
    "2026-01-10 - Drafted new README structure with TOC, TL;DR section, streamlined content (removes detailed command breakdowns to TIPS.md)"

    "2026-01-09 - Should Examples section go between 'Understanding the JSON Structure' and 'Best Practices' (~line 172)? Proposed content: domain coverage (research/learning, web app, novel, dissertation), emphasize non-software use cases, explain these are realistic snapshots not toy demos \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Decided: Section placed between 'Understanding the JSON Structure' and 'Best Practices' with AI-generated disclosure note and space for future real-world examples"
