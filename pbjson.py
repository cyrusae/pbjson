pbjson - Project state management for Claude-assisted development

A lightweight decision and work logger for projects developed with Claude AI assistance.
Designed to work within constrained environments (like Claude's project file system)
with a single-file deployment model.

PHILOSOPHY:
    - Track decisions, not just work
    - Human-readable and git-friendly (JSON + append-only log)
    - Works in Claude projects where multi-file packages are impractical
    - Supports multi-subsystem projects with prefix-based file naming

USAGE - Basic commands:
    pbjson decided "Decision made with reasoning"          # Record architectural decision
    pbjson built "Feature built (search: term)"            # Record completed work (searchable)
    pbjson question "Open question requiring input"        # Track open decision
    pbjson file "path/to/file.py - purpose"                # Mark important entry points (max 3-5)
    pbjson context "Background info or constraint"         # Store project context
    pbjson resolve "question keyword" "The decision made"   # Move question → resolution

USAGE - Multi-subsystem projects:
    # Via flag:
    pbjson --subsystem tracking decided "..."
    pbjson --subsystem glossary question "..."
    
    # Via colon syntax (shorter):
    pbjson decided:tracking "..."
    pbjson question:glossary "..."

EXAMPLES:
    pbjson decided "Use Obsidian for output - fast generation + graph view"
    pbjson built "arxiv_fetcher.py (fetches from arXiv API)"
    pbjson question "Should we cache synthesis results?"
    pbjson file "paper_library/orchestrator.py - main entry point"
    pbjson context "Token cost not a concern for this project"
    pbjson resolve "caching strategy" "Cache by paper DOI, invalidate on manual edit"

STATE FILE FORMAT:
    project.json (main)              - Top-level project decisions and work
    {subsystem}-state.json           - Subsystem-specific state (e.g., meta-tracking-state.json)
    
    Each file contains:
    {
        "what_we_decided": ["2026-01-08 - Decision text"],
        "what_we_built": ["2026-01-08 - Built feature (search: keyword)"],
        "what_we_need_to_decide": ["2026-01-08 - Open question"],
        "what_we_resolved": ["2026-01-08 - Question → Decision made"],
        "important_files": ["2026-01-08 - path/to/file - purpose"],
        "context": ["2026-01-08 - Background information"]
    }

PHILOSOPHY - When to use each field:
    decided:  Architectural decisions made WITH user agreement (not proposals)
    built:    Work completed; searchable by filename/feature (e.g., "built (as orchestrator.py)")
    question: Open questions needing user input or decisions
    resolved: Questions answered; shows question → decision mapping
    file:     Entry points ONLY (max 3-5) - "where do I start for X task?"
    context:  Constraints, user preferences, background facts for reference

CONSTRAINTS & DESIGN:
    - Single-file tool (works in Claude project context without package structure)
    - Append-only log (git-friendly, creates natural decision history)
    - Prefix-based subsystems (no nested dirs; works with file upload limits)
    - Python stdlib only (json, sys, pathlib, datetime)
    - No external dependencies
